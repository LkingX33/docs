# Documentation Writing Rules for Optimism Tech Writer

## Core Principles
- NEVER hallucinate technical details, specifications, or blockchain-specific information
- When uncertain about technical accuracy, create TODO comments for SMEs
- Prioritize accuracy over completeness
- Be transparent about knowledge gaps rather than making assumptions

## Technical Content Guidelines

### Blockchain & Optimism-Specific Content
- NEVER invent gas fees, transaction costs, or network parameters
- NEVER create fictional contract addresses, transaction hashes, or block numbers
- NEVER specify exact version numbers, release dates, or deprecation timelines without verification
- For OP Stack, L2 specifications, or protocol details: Use TODO for SME verification

### Code Examples & Configuration
- Only use verified, tested code examples from existing documentation
- For new code examples, mark with: `<!-- TODO: SME verify this code example works -->`
- NEVER create placeholder contract addresses - use TODO instead
- For configuration values, mark uncertain parameters: `# TODO: SME confirm default value`

### API & CLI Documentation
- NEVER invent API endpoints, parameters, or response structures
- For CLI commands, only document verified flags and options
- Mark uncertain syntax with: `<!-- TODO: SME verify command syntax -->`
- Use existing examples from official repositories when available

## TODO Format Guidelines

### Use these specific TODO formats:
```
<!-- TODO: SME verify [specific technical detail] -->
```

```
<!-- TODO: SME provide [missing information] -->
```

```
<!-- TODO: SME confirm [assumption or unclear point] -->
```

### Examples of good TODOs:
- `<!-- TODO: SME verify current gas limit for OP Mainnet -->`
- `<!-- TODO: SME provide example contract address for this network -->`
- `<!-- TODO: SME confirm if this API is deprecated in v2.0 -->`

## What You CAN Write Confidently
- General explanations of blockchain concepts
- Documentation structure and formatting
- User experience flow descriptions
- Clear, accurate rewrites of existing content
- Cross-references to official sources

## Red Flags - Stop and Add TODO Instead
- Specific version numbers without source
- Exact costs, fees, or limits
- Contract addresses or transaction hashes
- API endpoints not in existing docs
- Deprecation dates or upgrade timelines
- Performance benchmarks or statistics

## Documentation Structure
- Always include clear headings and navigation
- Add prerequisites and assumptions sections
- Include troubleshooting sections with common issues
- Link to official repositories and sources
- Use consistent formatting and style throughout

## Review Process
- Mark all TODOs with priority: [HIGH], [MEDIUM], [LOW]
- Group related TODOs to minimize SME review time
- Include context for why SME input is needed
- Reference specific sections of code/docs when available

## Quality Checks
Before submitting documentation:
1. No placeholder values (0x123..., example.com, etc.)
2. All technical claims have sources or TODOs
3. Code examples are from verified sources
4. No assumed knowledge about internal processes
5. Clear separation between general concepts and Optimism-specific details

## SME Collaboration
- Be specific about what type of expert is needed (protocol, infrastructure, API, etc.)
- Provide context about the user persona and use case
- Include links to related GitHub issues or PRs when relevant
- Suggest multiple options when uncertain between approaches

Remember: It's better to have accurate documentation with TODOs than polished documentation with errors.
