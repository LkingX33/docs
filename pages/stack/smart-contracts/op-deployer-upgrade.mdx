# Upgrade L1 contracts using `op-deployer`

[`op-deployer`](/operators/chain-operators/tools/op-deployer) simplifies the process of deploying the OP Stack. Using the `upgrade` command, you can upgrade a chain from one version to another.

It consists of several subcommands, one for each upgrade version. Think of it like a database migration: each upgrade command upgrades a chain from exactly one previous version to the next. A chain that is several versions behind can be upgrade to the latest version by running multiple upgrade commands in sequence.

Unlike the bootstrap or apply commands, upgrade does not directly interact with the chain. Instead, it generates calldata. You can then use this calldate with cast, Gnosis SAFE, superchain-ops, or whatever tooling you use to manage your L1.

## Limitations of `upgrade`

There are a few limitations to `upgrade`:

*   Your chain must be owned by a smart contract for upgrade to work because the OPCM can only be called via `DELEGATECALL`.
*   Only versions `1.8`, `2.0`, and `3.0` are supported. Upgrading from previous versions requires [a different workflow](/stack/smart-contracts/upgrade-op-contracts-1-6-1-8).

You can use `upgrade` alongside or independently from [`superchain-ops`](/stack/smart-contracts/superchain-ops-guide).

## Using `upgrade`

<Steps>

### Install `op-deployer`

[Install `op-deployer`](/operators/chain-operators/tools/op-deployer#installation) from source or pre-built binary.

### Create a `config.json` file

Create a `config.json` file using the following example:

```json
{
  "prank": "<address of the contract that owns the chain>",
  "opcm": "<address of the chain's OPCM>",
  "chainConfigs": [
    {
      "systemConfigProxy": "<address of the chain's system config proxy>",
      "proxyAdmin": "<address of the chain's proxy admin>",
      "absolutePrestate": "<32-byte hash of the chain's absolute prestate>"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Generate call data

Run the following command:

```bash
op-deployer upgrade <version> \
  --config <path to config JSON>
```

`version` must be either `2.0` or higher.

The output should look like:

```json
{
  "to": "<maps to the prank address>",
  "data": "<calldata>",
  "value": "0x0"
}
```

You can use the `<calldata>` field as the input for your upgrade transaction.
