# Bridging native cross-chain ETH transfers

<Callout>
  This tutorial provides step-by-step instructions for bridging ETH from one Superchain Interop chain to another.
  For a conceptual overview,
  see the [interoperable ETH explainer](../superchain-weth).
</Callout>

## Overview

Crosschain ETH transfers in the Superchain are facilitated through the [SuperchainWETH](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L2/SuperchainWETH.sol) contract.
This tutorial walks through how to send native ETH from one chain to another.
You can do this on [Supersim](../tools/supersim), [the Interop devnet](../tools/devnet), or production, once it is released.

Note that if the source chain uses native ETH as their gas token, but the destination chain uses a custom gas token, then the recipient will receive `SuperchainWETH` on the destination chain.

### What you'll build

*   A TypeScript application to transfer ETH chains

### What you'll learn

*   How to send ETH on the blockchain and between blockchains
*   How to relay messages between chains

## Prerequisites

Before starting this tutorial, ensure your development environment meets the following requirements:

### Technical knowledge

*   Intermediate TypeScript knowledge
*   Understanding of smart contract development
*   Familiarity with blockchain concepts

### Development environment

*   Unix-like operating system (Linux, macOS, or WSL for Windows)
*   Node.js version 16 or higher
*   Git for version control

### Required tools

The tutorial uses these primary tools:

*   Foundry: For smart contract development
*   Supersim: For local blockchain simulation
*   TypeScript: For implementation
*   Viem: For blockchain interaction

<Steps>
  ### Configure the network

  1.  Install [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation).

  <Tabs items={['Supersim', 'Interop devnet']}>
    <Tabs.Tab>
      2.  Follow the [Installation Guide](/app-developers/tutorials/supersim/getting-started/installation) to install [Supersim](../tools/supersim) for running blockchains with Interop.

      3.  Supersim uses Foundry's `anvil` blockchains, which start with ten prefunded accounts.
          Set these environment variables to access one of those accounts on the L2 blockchains.

          ```sh
          export PRIVATE_KEY=0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80
          ```

        ```sh
        cast balance --ether `cast wallet address $PRIVATE_KEY` --rpc-url http://localhost:9545
        cast balance --ether `cast wallet address $PRIVATE_KEY` --rpc-url http://localhost:9546
        ```
      </details>
    </Tabs.Tab>

    <Tabs.Tab>
      2.  Set `PRIVATE_KEY` to the private key of an address that has [Sepolia ETH](https://cloud.google.com/application/web3/faucet/ethereum/sepolia).

          ```sh
          export PRIVATE_KEY=0x<private key here>
          ```

      3.  Send ETH to the two L2 blockchains.

          ```sh
          cast send --rpc-url https://endpoints.omniatech.io/v1/eth/sepolia/public --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY --value 0.02ether 0x7385d89d38ab79984e7c84fab9ce5e6f4815468a
          cast send --rpc-url https://endpoints.omniatech.io/v1/eth/sepolia/public --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY --value 0.02ether 0x55f5c4653dbcde7d1254f9c690a5d761b315500c
          ```

      4.  Wait a few minutes until you can see the ETH [on the block explorer](https://sid.testnet.routescan.io/) for your address.

            ```sh
            cast balance --ether `cast wallet address $PRIVATE_KEY` --rpc-url https://interop-alpha-0.optimism.io/
            cast balance --ether `cast wallet address $PRIVATE_KEY` --rpc-url https://interop-alpha-1.optimism.io/
            ```
          </details>

  ### Create the TypeScript project

  We need to create an executing message on the destination chain, and for that we use [the `@eth-optimism/viem` package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@eth-optimism/viem).

  1.  Create a new TypeScript project.

      ```sh
      mkdir transfer-eth
      cd transfer-eth
      npm init -y
      npm install --save-dev -y viem tsx @types/node @eth-optimism/viem typescript
      mkdir src
      ```

  2.  Download the ABI for `SuperchainWETH`.

      ```sh
      wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/refs/heads/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/snapshots/abi/SuperchainWETH.json
      mv SuperchainWETH.json src/SuperchainWETH.abi.json
      ```

  3.  Place this in `src/transfer-eth.mts`:

      ```typescript file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/transfer-eth.mts hash=41c1d559ac010d3407a3c056f2f49405 
      ```

      <details>
        <summary>Explanation</summary>

        ```typescript file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/transfer-eth.mts#L13-L18 hash=5312f4634ac8762504935cd52d18c8ab 
        ```

        Import all chain definitions from `@eth-optimism/viem`.

        ```typescript file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/transfer-eth.mts#L29-L32 hash=56873f8d2eebe5975a0c0b9ac7eecfe7 
        ```

        If the address we use is `0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266`, one of the prefunded addresses on `anvil`, assume we're using Supersim.
        Otherwise, use Interop devnet.

        ```typescript file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/transfer-eth.mts#L78-L80 hash=4933c70a9078c2369ef90bfe163f5fd7 
        ```

        To relay a message we need the information in the receipt.
        Also, we need to wait until the transaction with the relayed message is actually part of a block.

        ```typescript file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/transfer-eth.mts#L87-L89 hash=573f22b2b21415ff51c59c713fda07d1 
        ```

        A single transaction can send multiple messages.
        But here we know we sent just one, so we look for the first one in the list.

        ```typescript file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/transfer-eth.mts#L90-L96 hash=4b26775b46c116262af4c7299d6f1127 
        ```

        This is how you use `@eth-optimism/viem` to create an executing message.

  ### Run the example

  1.  Run the example.

      ```sh
      npx tsx src/transfer-eth.mts
      ```

  2.  Read the results.

      ```
      Before transfer

              Address: 0x7ED53BfaA58B79Dd655B2f229258C093b6C09A8C
              Balance on source chain: 0.020999799151902245
              Balance on destination chain: 0.026999459226731331
      ```

      The initial state.

      ```
      After transfer on source chain

              Address: 0x7ED53BfaA58B79Dd655B2f229258C093b6C09A8C
              Balance on source chain: 0.019999732176717961
              Balance on destination chain: 0.026999459226731331
      ```

      After the initiating message the balance on the source chain is immediately reduced.
      Notice that even though we are sending 0.001 ETH, the balance on the source chain is reduced by a bit more (here, approximately 67 gwei).
      This is the cost of the initiating transaction on the source chain.
      Of course, as there has been no transaction on the destination chain, that balance is unchanged.

      ```
      After relaying message to destination chain

              Address: 0x7ED53BfaA58B79Dd655B2f229258C093b6C09A8C
              Balance on source chain: 0.019999732176717961
              Balance on destination chain: 0.027999278943880868    
      ```

      Now the balance on the destination chain increases, by slightly less than 0.001 ETH.
      The executing message also has a transaction cost (in this case, about 180gwei).
