# Overview

Permissionless fault proofs are a critical component of the OP Stack's security model. They allow anyone to challenge invalid state proposals, ensuring the correctness of L2 to L1 withdrawals without relying on trusted third parties. 
To enable this functionality, chain operators must generate and maintain the necessary absolute prestate and preimage files.
The absolute prestate is a commitment to the initial state of the fault proof program, and the preimage is the serialized binary representation of this program state. 
These files are essential for the op-challenger tool to participate in dispute games when challenging invalid claims.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

*   [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) running
*   Have sufficient disk space and memory

## Using the latest absolute prestate and multi-threaded Cannon

As of the latest releases, OP Stack chains should utilize the `64-bit` MIPS multi-threaded version of Cannon. 
This upgrade offers several advantages:

*   Improved performance through parallelized execution
*   Enhanced fault proof VM capabilities
*   Support for the latest network upgrades

<Callout type="info">
  Beginning with [Upgrade 14](/notices/upgrade-14), all chains should use the `64-bit` multi-threaded version of Cannon. 
  The absolute prestate files for this version typically have the format `prestate-mt64.bin.gz`.
</Callout>

## Generating the absolute prestate

<Steps>
  ### Clone and checkout the tagged version

  First, clone the Optimism monorepo and check out the appropriate [release tag](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/tags) for op-program:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism.git
  cd optimism
  git checkout op-program/v1.6.1-rc.1  # Use the latest tagged version
  git submodule update --init --recursive # Initialize submodules

```

### Build the op-program

Build the op-program binary:

```bash
make op-program
```

### Generate the absolute prestate

Generate the prestate by running the op-program binary directly:

```bash
make reproducible-prestate
cd ..
```

The output should look like this:

```bash

-------------------- Production Prestates --------------------

Cannon64 Absolute prestate hash: 
0x03eb07101fbdeaf3f04d9fb76526362c1eea2824e4c6e970bdb19675b72e4fc8

-------------------- Experimental Prestates --------------------

CannonInterop Absolute prestate hash: 
0x03fc3b4d091527d53f1ff369ea8ed65e5e17cc7fc98ebf75380238151cdc949c

Cannon64Next Absolute prestate hash: 
0x03eb07101fbdeaf3f04d9fb76526362c1eea2824e4c6e970bdb19675b72e4fc8

```

  The output should display three prestate hashes:

  *   `Cannon64`: The current production absolute prestate hash for the 64-bit version of Cannon
  *   `CannonInterop`: The absolute prestate hash used for interoperability
  *   `Cannon64Next`: The next state version for Cannon with in-progress features (like Go 1.24 support)

  For permissionless fault proofs, you'll primarily use the Cannon64 absolute prestate hash.

  ### Prepare the preimage file

  After generating the prestate, find the preimage file.
  You should see a file named `prestate-mt64.bin.gz` or similar (the exact name might vary based on the version).
  Rename this file to include the prestate hash:
  The preimage file is located at `op-program/bin/prestate-mt64.bin.gz`. Rename it to match the prestate hash:

  ```bash
  cd op-program/bin
  mv prestate-mt64.bin.gz 0x[CANNON64_PRESTATE_HASH].bin.gz
  ```

  Replace `[CANNON64_PRESTATE_HASH]` with the actual `Cannon64` absolute prestate hash value from the output.
  This file needs to be uploaded to a location that's accessible by your op-challenger instances.
</Steps>

## Official prestate hashes for Superchain registry chains

The Superchain registry maintains official absolute prestate hashes for chains that are part of the registry. 
These prestates include the configurations of all chains in the Superchain registry.
For chains listed in the Superchain registry, you should use the official prestate hashes rather than generating your own.

You can find the latest prestate tags in the [Superchain registry](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/blob/main/validation/standard/standard-prestates.toml).

## Handling unannounced chain configurations

If your chain is not included in the Superchain registry, you'll need to generate a custom prestate with your specific chain configuration. This applies to:

*   New chains
*   Chains with custom configurations

For these cases, follow these additional steps:

<Steps>

### Create a directory for your custom chain configuration
```bash
mkdir -p op-program/chainconfig/configs
```

### Copy your chain configuration files to this directory

First, you need to obtain your chain's configuration files. These are typically generated when you [deploy your L2 chain](/operators/chain-operators/deploy/smart-contracts) with op-deployer:

*   ***rollup.json**: The rollup configuration file
*   **genesis.json**: The L2 genesis file 

Name them according to the required format:

```bash
# Replace 67865 with your actual chain ID
cp /path/to/rollup.json op-program/chainconfig/configs/67865-rollup.json
cp /path/to/genesis.json op-program/chainconfig/configs/67865-genesis-l2.json
```
Note: The naming format is critical - the files must be named as:

*   `<L2-chain-id>-rollup.json`
*   `<L2-chain-id>-genesis-l2.json`

These files are outputs from your L2 chain deployment process using op-deployer.

### Generate the prestate

From the root of the monorepo, run:

```bash
make reproducible-prestate
```
Alternatively, you can also specify the paths directly:

```bash
make reproducible-prestate ROLLUP_CONFIG=/path/to/67865-rollup.json L2_GENESIS=/path/to/67865-genesis-l2.json
```

This should generate output containing three prestate hashes:

```bash
-------------------- Production Prestates --------------------

Cannon64 Absolute prestate hash: 
0x03eb07101fbdeaf3f04d9fb76526362c1eea2824e4c6e970bdb19675b72e4fc8

-------------------- Experimental Prestates --------------------

CannonInterop Absolute prestate hash: 
0x03fc3b4d091527d53f1ff369ea8ed65e5e17cc7fc98ebf75380238151cdc949c

Cannon64Next Absolute prestate hash: 
0x03eb07101fbdeaf3f04d9fb76526362c1eea2824e4c6e970bdb19675b72e4fc8

```

For current production use, you should use the `Cannon64` Absolute prestate hash.

### Locate and prepare the preimage File
Follow this [step](/operators/chain-operators/tutorials/absolute-prestate#prepare-the-preimage-file)

</Steps>

## Deploying and configuring with the absolute prestate

After generating the absolute prestate and preimage files, you'll need to:

<Steps>
  ### Upload preimage file

  Upload the preimage file to a location accessible by your op-challenger instances

  ### Configure op-challenger

  Configure the op-challenger to use this prestate:

  ```bash
  docker run -d --name op-challenger \
    -e OP_CHALLENGER_TRACE_TYPE=permissioned,cannon \
    -e OP_CHALLENGER_PRESTATES_URL=<YOUR_PRESTATES_URL> \
    -e OP_CHALLENGER_L1_ETH_RPC=<YOUR_L1_RPC_URL> \
    -e OP_CHALLENGER_GAME_FACTORY_ADDRESS=<YOUR_DISPUTE_GAME_FACTORY> \
    -e OP_CHALLENGER_PRIVATE_KEY=<YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_OR_USE_WALLET_SIGNER> \
    -e OP_CHALLENGER_NETWORK=<YOUR_NETWORK> \
    -e OP_CHALLENGER_CANNON_ROLLUP_CONFIG=<PATH_TO_ROLLUP_CONFIG> \
    -e OP_CHALLENGER_CANNON_L2_GENESIS=<PATH_TO_GENESIS_CONFIG> \
    -v /path/to/local/prestates:/prestates \
    us-docker.pkg.dev/oplabs-tools-artifacts/images/op-challenger:latest #use the latest version
  ```


  Replace `<URL_TO_PRESTATES_DIRECTORY>` with the URL where you've stored your prestate files.
  The `--prestates-url` should point to the directory where you've uploaded the renamed prestate file from step 3.

</Steps>

<Callout type="info">
Ensure you're using the latest op-challenger version, see the [release page](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/release)
The dispute game factory address must be manually specified via the `--game-factory-address` option.
If your chain uses interoperability features, you'll need to add a `depsets.json` file to the `op-program/chainconfig/configs` directory. 
This file contains dependency set configurations in the same format as the op-supervisor's configs. You can extract this from your existing op-supervisor setup.
