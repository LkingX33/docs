# Overview

Permissionless fault proofs are a critical component of the OP Stack's security model. They allow anyone to challenge invalid state proposals, ensuring the correctness of L2 to L1 withdrawals without relying on trusted third parties. 
To enable this functionality, chain operators must generate and maintain the necessary absolute prestate and preimage files.
The absolute prestate is a commitment to the initial state of the fault proof program, and the preimage is the serialized binary representation of this program state. 
These files are essential for the op-challenger tool to participate in dispute games when challenging invalid claims.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

*   Run `op-contracts/v2.0.0` or higher on your chain
*   You have sufficient system resources (memory and disk space)

## Using the latest AP and multi-threaded Cannon

As of the latest releases, OP Stack chains should utilize the `64-bit` MIPS multi-threaded version of Cannon. 
This upgrade offers several advantages:

*   Improved performance through parallelized execution
*   Enhanced fault proof VM capabilities
*   Support for the latest network upgrades

<Callout type="info">
  Beginning with [Upgrade 14](/notices/upgrade-14), all chains should use the `64-bit` multi-threaded version of Cannon. 
  The absolute prestate files for this version typically have the format `prestate-mt64.bin.gz`.
</Callout>

## Generating the absolute prestate

<Steps>
  ### Clone and checkout the tagged version

  First, clone the Optimism monorepo and check out the appropriate [release tag](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/tags) for op-program:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism.git
  cd optimism
  git checkout op-program/v1.6.1-rc.1  # Use the latest tagged version

  ```

  <Callout type="important">
    Always use a specific tagged version of op-program as specified in the Superchain registry or official release notes. Current releases use versions like `op-program/v1.6.0-rc.2` for Isthmus hardfork support.
  </Callout>

  ### Initialize the repository

  Initialize the repository with all necessary dependencies:

  ```bash
  make devnet-genesis
  ```

  Generate the absolute prestate by running:

  ```bash
  cd op-program
  make cannon-prestate
  ```

  This command will:

  1.  Compile the op-program
  2.  Generate the absolute prestate hash
  3.  Create the preimage file

  ### Verify the generated prestate

  Verify the absolute prestate by checking the hash:

  ```bash
  cd ..# Return to monorepo root
  ./op-program/bin/op-program --version
  ```

  The output should display three prestate hashes:

  *   Cannon absolute prestate hash (legacy)
  *   Cannon64 absolute prestate hash (64-bit version)
  *   CannonInterop absolute prestate hash (for interoperability)

  For permissionless fault proofs, you'll primarily use the Cannon64 absolute prestate hash.

  ### Prepare the preimage file

  The preimage file is located at `op-program/bin/prestate-mt64.bin.gz`. Rename it to match the prestate hash:

  ```bash
  cd op-program/bin
  mv prestate-mt64.bin.gz 0x[CANNON64_PRESTATE_HASH].bin.gz
  ```

  Replace `[CANNON64_PRESTATE_HASH]` with the actual `Cannon64` absolute prestate hash value from the output.
</Steps>

## Official prestate hashes for Superchain registry chains

The Superchain registry maintains official absolute prestate hashes for chains that are part of the registry. 
These prestates include the configurations of all chains in the Superchain registry.

<Callout type="note">
  For chains listed in the Superchain registry, you should use the official prestate hashes rather than generating your own.
</Callout>

You can find the latest prestate tags in the [Superchain registry](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/blob/main/validation/standard/standard-prestates.toml).

Current official prestate hashes for Isthmus hardfork (as of writing):

*   Sepolia chains: `0x03682932cec7ce0a3874b19675a6bbc923054a7b321efc7d3835187b172494b6` (using op-program/v1.6.0-rc.2)

## Handling unannounced chain configurations

If your chain is not included in the Superchain registry, you'll need to generate a custom prestate with your specific chain configuration. This applies to:

*   New chains
*   Chains with custom configurations
*   "Stealth launches" or other unannounced chains

For these cases, follow these additional steps:

### For chains not in the Superchain registry

<Steps>
  ### Prepare configuration files

  Ensure your chain's rollup configuration and L2 genesis file are accessible

  ### Generate custom prestate
  Generate the absolute prestate using your specific configuration:

  ```bash
  cd op-program
  make cannon-prestate ROLLUP_CONFIG=/path/to/your/rollup.json L2_GENESIS=/path/to/your/genesis-l2.json
  ```

  ### Process and verify

  Verify and prepare the preimage file as described in Steps 4-5 above
</Steps>

<Callout type="warning">
  The initial prestate used for permissioned games doesn't include the necessary chain configuration for the Fault proof system. 
  The assumption is that the chain operator, the single permissioned actor, will not challenge their own games. 
  So the absolute prestate on the initial `PermissionedDisputeGame` will never be used.

  When deploying a new chain, you must first deploy the L1 contracts and then retrieve the artifacts. 
  These are inputs to the creation of the absolute prestate and this circular dependency is the reason chains cannot be deployed directly to the permissionless Fault Proof System.
</Callout>

## Deploying and configuring with the absolute prestate

After generating the absolute prestate and preimage files, you'll need to:

<Steps>
  ### Upload preimage file

  Upload the preimage file to a location accessible by your op-challenger instances

  ### Configure op-challenger

  Configure the op-challenger to use this prestate:

  ```bash
  op-challenger \
    --trace-type permissioned,cannon \
    --prestates-url <URL_TO_PRESTATES_DIRECTORY> \
    --l1-eth-rpc <YOUR_L1_RPC_URL> \
    --game-factory-address <YOUR_DISPUTE_GAME_FACTORY> \
    --network <YOUR_NETWORK>
  ```

  Replace `<URL_TO_PRESTATES_DIRECTORY>` with the URL where you've stored your prestate files.

</Steps>

## Next Steps

After successfully generating and deploying the absolute prestate:

1.  Monitor your op-challenger service to ensure it can properly participate in dispute games
2.  Consider setting up redundant challenger instances for enhanced reliability
3.  Keep track of future upgrades that may require new absolute prestates
