# Migrating to permissionless fault proofs on OP Stack

This guide provides a high-level overview for chain operators looking to transition their OP Stack from permissioned to permissionless fault proofs. It's designed to be accessible for technical decision makers while providing sufficient detail for implementation teams.

## Overview

The OP Stack architecture uses Fault Proofs to ensure the validity of withdrawals from L2 to L1.
Transitioning from permissioned to permissionless proofs represents a significant security upgrade, allowing any participant to propose and challenge state output roots.
Permissioned games previously relied on a single trusted validator—typically the proposer configured in the `PermissionedDisputeGame`, usually the network's only sequencer.

This migration involves several key components:

*   Configuring security-critical dispute [monitoring services](/operators/chain-operators/tools/chain-monitoring)
*   Deploying and configuring smart contracts using [op-deployer](/operators/chain-operators/tools/op-deployer)
*   Testing the new system before activation
*   Setting the respected game type to permissionless fault proofs, specifically using the `FaultDisputeGame`

## Prerequisites

Before beginning this transition, your chain should:

*   Be running a standard OP Stack implementation
*   Be operating with the recommended infrastructure services including [`op-challenger`](/stack/fault-proofs/challenger) and [`op-dispute-mon`](/operators/chain-operators/tools/chain-monitoring#dispute-mon)

## 1. Configure the dispute components

The `op-challenger` and `op-dispute-mon` services are critical security components that participate in the dispute game process to challenge invalid proposals and monitor active games.

### Upgrade to the latest `op-challenger`

Upgrade to the [latest release](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/releases), which contains important improvements to simplify the upgrade process.

We recommend using the official Docker images for reliability and ease of deployment:

```bash
# Pull the latest version
docker pull us-docker.pkg.dev/oplabs-tools-artifacts/images/op-challenger:latest
```
Then run the image, for example:

```bash
docker run -d --name op-challenger \
  -e OP_CHALLENGER_TRACE_TYPE=permissioned,cannon \
  -e OP_CHALLENGER_PRESTATES_URL=<YOUR_PRESTATES_URL> \
  us-docker.pkg.dev/oplabs-tools-artifacts/images/op-challenger:v1.3.3

  ```
Replace `<YOUR_PRESTATES_URL>` with your actual prestates URL.

If your deployment requires building from source, you can alternatively use:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism -b op-challenger/v1.3.3 --recurse-submodules
cd optimism
make op-challenger
```

### Update network configuration

Configure `op-challenger` to load your chain configuration. Even if your chain is not included in the [superchain-registry](/superchain/superchain-registry), you can specify a custom configuration:

```bash
# For chains in the registry
--network <chain-name>

# For chains not in the registry, provide a path to your rollup configuration
*   `<chain-id>-rollup.json` - Your rollup configuration
*   `<chain-id>-genesis-l2.json` - Your L2 genesis file
```

### Enable cannon trace type

Configure `op-challenger` to support both permissioned and permissionless games by setting:

```bash
--trace-type permissioned,cannon
```

Or by setting the environment variable:

```
OP_CHALLENGER_TRACE_TYPE=permissioned,cannon
```

### Configure prestates access

Replace the `--cannon-prestate` flag with `--prestates-url`, which points to a source containing all required prestates:

```bash
--prestates-url <URL_TO_PRESTATES_DIRECTORY>
```

The URL can use `http`, `https`, or `file` protocols. Each prestate should be named as `<PRESTATE_HASH>.json` or `<PRESTATE_HASH>.bin.gz`.

### Building required prestates for chains not in the Superchain Registry

You'll need to deploy two new dispute game contracts with the new absolute prestate:

1.  `FaultDisputeGame`
2.  `PermissionedDisputeGame`

<Callout type="info">
  The initial prestate used for permissioned games doesn't include the necessary chain configuration for the Fault Proof System. The assumption is that the chain operator, the single permissioned actor, will not challenge their own games. So the absolute prestate on the initial `PermissionedDisputeGame` will never be used.
  When deploying a new chain, you must first deploy the L1 contracts and then generate the chain genesis file and rollup configuration files.
  These are inputs to the creation of the absolute prestate and this circular dependency is the reason chains cannot be deployed directly to the permissionless Fault Proof System. 
</Callout>

For chains not in the Superchain Registry, you need to build custom prestates with your chain's configuration:

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism --recurse-submodules
cd optimism

# 2. Create a branch from the latest op-program release
git checkout -b op-program/chainconfig op-program/v1.5.0

# 3. Add your chain configuration to the op-program chainconfig directory
# Your rollup config must be named <chain-id>-rollup.json
# Your L2 genesis must be named <chain-id>-genesis-l2.json
mkdir -p op-program/chainconfig/configs 
cp /path/to/your/rollup-config.json op-program/chainconfig/configs/<YOUR_L2_CHAIN_ID>-rollup.json
cp /path/to/your/l2-genesis.json op-program/chainconfig/configs/<YOUR_L2_CHAIN_ID>-genesis-l2.json

# 4. Build the reproducible prestate
make reproducible-prestate
```

The prestate will typically be generated at:

*   `op-program/bin/prestate.json` (for older versions)
*   `op-program/bin/prestate.bin.gz` (for intermediate versions)
*   `op-program/bin/prestate-mt64.bin.gz` (for chains upgraded to Cannon MT64, starting from [upgrade 14](/notices/upgrade-14#whats-included-in-upgrade-14))

<Callout type="info">
  Post-upgrade 14, chains are expected to use `prestate-mt64.bin.gz` due to the Fault Proof VM contract upgrade to `cannon-mt64`.
  The older `prestate.bin.gz` will eventually be deprecated but is temporarily retained until all chains complete the upgrade.
</Callout>

### Ensure sufficient funds for bonds

Bonds are required for both permissioned and permissionless games.
However, with permissioned games, you typically don't post claims regularly, making bond requirements less noticeable.
In contrast, the challenger in permissionless games will frequently need to post bonds with each claim it makes.
Therefore, ensure your challenger has sufficient funds available.

As a general guideline:

*   Maintain a minimum balance of 50 ETH
*   Have access to a large pool of ETH for potential attack scenarios
*   Implement monitoring to ensure sufficient funds are always available

### Set up `op-dispute-mon`

Ensure `op-dispute-mon` is properly configured by following these [steps](/operators/chain-operators/tools/chain-monitoring#dispute-mon)

## 2. Deploy and configure smart contracts using OPCM

This section requires privileged actions by the `ProxyAdminOwner` and may involve the `Guardian` role depending on your security setup.

### Understanding ProxyAdmin Owner and Guardian roles

This migration requires actions by privileged roles in your system:

*   The **ProxyAdmin Owner** has the authority to upgrade proxy contracts.

*   The **Guardian** has emergency powers like pausing withdrawals and changing the respected game type.

For detailed information about privileged roles and their security implications, refer to the [privileged roles documentation](/superchain/privileged-roles).

### Adding the PermissionlessDisputeGame to a chain

Given that not all chains will support the `PermissionlessDisputeGame` upon deployment, an
`OPCM.addGameType()` method will be added which will orchestrate the actions required to add a
new game type.

This method will:

1.  deploy the `FaultDisputeGame` contract
2.  setup the `DelayedWethProxy` for the new game
3.  Reinitialize the `AnchorStateRegistry` to add the new game type.

See a high‐level implementation from the [spec](https://specs.optimism.io/experimental/op-contracts-manager.html#implementation-2)

### Set game implementations

This section applies only to chains running `op-contracts/v2.0.0` (post-upgrade 13).

<Callout type="info">
  As stated in the prerequisites, chains must be running op-contracts/v2.0.0 (post-upgrade 13) to follow this guide. 
  For chains on earlier versions, the upgrade process is significantly different and not covered here.
</Callout>

Since you're on post-upgrade 13, you only need to initialize bond amounts for both game types. 
The anchor state for permissionless games automatically matches the one used by permissioned games, as there's only a single shared anchor state.

To set the bond amounts, create an `input.json` file with transactions to set the initial bond values:

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "name": "DisputeGameFactory - Set Init Bonds",
    "description": "Set initial bonds (0.08 ETH) for gameTypes 0 and 1"
  },
  "transactions": [
    {
      "metadata": {
        "name": "Sets the bond value for permissioned game type",
        "description": "This sets the initial bond to 0.08 ETH to deploy a PermissionedDisputeGame."
      },
      "to": "<DISPUTE_GAME_FACTORY_PROXY_ADDRESS>",
      "value": "0x0",
      "data": "0x1e3342400000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000011c37937e080000", 
      "contractMethod": {
        "type": "function",
        "name": "setInitBond",
        "inputs": [
          {
            "name": "_gameType",
            "type": "uint32"
          },
          {
            "name": "_initBond",
            "type": "uint256"
          }
        ],
        "outputs": [],
        "stateMutability": "nonpayable"
      },
      "contractInputsValues": {
        "_gameType": "1",
        "_initBond": "80000000000000000"
      }
    },
    {
      "metadata": {
        "name": "Sets the bond value for permissionless",
        "description": "This sets the initial bond to 0.08 ETH to deploy a FaultDisputeGame."
      },
      "to": "<DISPUTE_GAME_FACTORY_PROXY_ADDRESS>",
      "value": "0x0",
      "data": "0x1e3342400000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000011c37937e080000", 
      "contractMethod": {
        "type": "function",
        "name": "setInitBond",
        "inputs": [
          {
            "name": "_gameType",
            "type": "uint32"
          },
          {
            "name": "_initBond",
            "type": "uint256"
          }
        ],
        "outputs": [],
        "stateMutability": "nonpayable"
      },
      "contractInputsValues": {
        "_gameType": "0",
        "_initBond": "80000000000000000"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

You should simulate this transaction bundle with Tenderly before execution and verify the expected state changes:

For game type 0 (CANNON): The initial bond is set to 0.08 ETH
For game type 1 (PERMISSIONED): The initial bond is set to 0.08 ETH

You can verify the storage slots after execution:

```bash
# Verify bond value for game type 0 (CANNON)
cast index uint 0 102
```
Where `0` is the game type and `102` is the [storage slot](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/33f06d2d5e4034125df02264a5ffe84571bd0359/packages/contracts-bedrock/snapshots/storageLayout/DisputeGameFactory.json#L48)

```bash
# Verify bond value for game type 1 (PERMISSIONED)
cast index uint 1 102
```

Where `1` is the game type and `102` is the [storage slot](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/33f06d2d5e4034125df02264a5ffe84571bd0359/packages/contracts-bedrock/snapshots/storageLayout/DisputeGameFactory.json#L48).

<Callout type="info">
  Ensure a permissioned game has already resolved with the correct root and updated the anchor state to a valid value.
  Initial deployments at genesis always have an invalid anchor state.
</Callout>


## 3. Testing off-chain agents

After you've set the permissionless `FaultDisputeContract` implementations on the `DisputeGameFactory` and before you set the respected game type to it; you can test your off-chain services in the cold path.

### Test defending valid proposals

Create a valid proposal using the permissionless game type `0`:

1.  Ensure the proposal is from a block at or before the `safe` head:
    ```bash
    cast block --rpc-url <OP_GETH_ENDPOINT> safe
    ```

2.  Get a valid output root:
    ```bash
    cast rpc --rpc-url <OP_NODE_ENDPOINT> optimism_outputAtBlock \
      $(cast 2h <BLOCK_NUMBER>) | jq -r .outputRoot
    ```

3.  Create a test game:
    ```bash
    ./op-challenger/bin/op-challenger create-game \
      --l1-eth-rpc=<L1_RPC_ENDPOINT> \
      --game-factory-address <DISPUTE_GAME_FACTORY_ADDR> \
      --l2-block-num <BLOCK_NUMBER> \
      --output-root <OUTPUT_ROOT> \
      <SIGNER_OPTIONS>
    ```

4.  Verify:
    *   `op-challenger` logs a message showing the game is in progress
    *   `op-challenger` doesn't post a counter claim (as this is a valid proposal)
    *   `dispute-mon` includes the new game with `status="agree_defender_ahead"`

### Test countering invalid claims

Post an invalid counter claim to the valid proposal created above:

```bash
./op-challenger/bin/op-challenger move \
  --l1-eth-rpc <L1_RPC_ENDPOINT> \
  --game-address <GAME_ADDR> \
  --attack \
  --parent-index 0 \
  --claim 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 \
  <SIGNER_OPTIONS>
```

Verify that `op-challenger` posts a counter-claim to the invalid claim. You can view claims using:

```bash
./op-challenger/bin/op-challenger list-claims \
  --l1-eth-rpc <L1_RPC_ENDPOINT> \
  --game-address <GAME_ADDR>
```

There should be 3 claims in the game after this test.

## 4. Switch to permissionless proofs

After completing all previous steps and verifying their successful operation, you need to update the `respectedGameType` in the `OptimismPortal`. This requires execution through the appropriate privileged role (typically the Deputy Guardian):

1. Create an `input.json` file with the transaction to update the `respectedGameType`:

```json
{
  "chainId": "<YOUR_L1_CHAIN_ID>",
  "metadata": {
    "name": "Deputy Guardian - Enable Permissionless Dispute Game",
    "description": "This task updates the `respectedGameType` in the `OptimismPortal` to `CANNON`, enabling users to permissionlessly propose outputs as well as for anyone to participate in the dispute of these proposals. This action requires all in-progress withdrawals to be re-proven against a new `FaultDisputeGame` that was created after this update occurs."
  },
  "transactions": [
    {
      "metadata": {
        "name": "Update `respectedGameType` in the `OptimismPortal`",
        "description": "Updates the `respectedGameType` to `CANNON` in the `OptimismPortal`, enabling permissionless proposals and challenging."
      },
      "to": "<SUPERCHAIN_CONFIG_MANAGER_ADDRESS>",
      "value": "0x0",
      "data": "0xa1155ed9000000000000000000000000<OPTIMISM_PORTAL_ADDRESS>0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
      "contractMethod": {
        "type": "function",
        "name": "setRespectedGameType",
        "inputs": [
          {
            "name": "_portal",
            "type": "address"
          },
          {
            "name": "_gameType",
            "type": "uint32"
          }
        ],
        "outputs": [],
        "stateMutability": "nonpayable"
      },
      "contractInputsValues": {
        "_gameType": "0",
        "_portal": "<OPTIMISM_PORTAL_ADDRESS>"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

2.Simulate this transaction with Tenderly before execution to verify the expected state changes:

*   The `respectedGameType` in the `OptimismPortal` contract will be changed from `1` (PERMISSIONED) to `0` (CANNON)

3. After execution, you can verify the storage slot change:

```bash 
#Check the storage slot 0x3b in the OptimismPortalProxy
# The last byte should change from 0x01 to 0x00
cast storage <OPTIMISM_PORTAL_ADDRESS> 0x3b
```

4. Configure `op-proposer` to create proposals using the permissionless `cannon` game type:
```bash
# Change from game-type 1 to 0
--game-type 0
```
Or via environment variable:

```bash
OP_PROPOSER_GAME_TYPE=0
```

<Callout type="info">
  This action requires all in-progress withdrawals to be re-proven against a new `FaultDisputeGame` that will be created after this update occurs.
</Callout>

## Conclusion

Transitioning to permissionless proofs represents a significant security improvement for your OP Stack chain. This transition decentralizes the validation process, allowing any participant to challenge invalid withdrawal claims rather than relying on a limited set of trusted validators.

By following this guide, you'll be able to safely configure and test your system before making the switch to permissionless proofs. Remember to thoroughly test each service before proceeding to the next step, and ensure that your security monitoring is properly configured to track the health of the system after the transition.
