# Migrating to permissionless fault proofs on OP Stack

This guide provides a high-level overview for chain operators looking to transition their OP Stack from permissioned to permissionless fault proofs. It's designed to be accessible for technical decision makers while providing sufficient detail for implementation teams.

## Overview

The OP Stack architecture uses Fault Proofs to ensure the validity of withdrawals from L2 to L1.
The validity of transactions on L2 is handled by the node's consensus rules.
Transitioning from permissioned to permissionless proofs represents a significant security upgrade, allowing any participant to propose and challenge state output roots.
Permissioned games previously relied on a single trusted validatorâ€”typically the proposer configured in the `PermissionedDisputeGame`, usually the network's only sequencer.

This migration involves several key components:

*   Configuring security-critical dispute [monitoring services](/operators/chain-operators/tools/chain-monitoring)
*   Deploying and configuring smart contracts using [op-deployer](/operators/chain-operators/tools/op-deployer)
*   Testing the new system before activation
*   Setting the expected game type to permissionless fault proofs, specifically using the `FaultDisputeGame`

## Prerequisites

Before beginning this transition, your chain should:

*   Be running a standard OP Stack implementation
*   Be operating with the recommended infrastructure services including [`op-challenger`](/stack/fault-proofs/challenger) and [`op-dispute-mon`](/operators/chain-operators/tools/chain-monitoring#dispute-mon)

## 1. Configure the dispute components

The `op-challenger` and `op-dispute-mon` services are critical security components that participate in the dispute game process to challenge invalid proposals and monitor active games.

### Upgrade to the latest `op-challenger`

Upgrade to the [latest release](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/releases), which contains important improvements to simplify the upgrade process.

```bash
# Example upgrade command (implementation may vary based on your deployment)
git clone https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism -b op-challenger/v1.3.3 --recurse-submodules
cd optimism
make op-challenger
```

### Update network configuration

Configure `op-challenger` to load your chain configuration. Even if your chain is not included in the [superchain-registry](/superchain/superchain-registry), you can specify a custom configuration:

```bash
# For chains in the registry
--network <chain-name>

# For chains not in the registry, provide a path to your rollup configuration
--network-config /path/to/your/network-config.json
```

### Enable cannon trace type

Configure `op-challenger` to support both permissioned and permissionless games by setting:

```bash
--trace-type permissioned,cannon
```

Or by setting the environment variable:

```
OP_CHALLENGER_TRACE_TYPE=permissioned,cannon
```

### Configure prestates access

Replace the `--cannon-prestate` flag with `--prestates-url`, which points to a source containing all required prestates:

```bash
--prestates-url <URL_TO_PRESTATES_DIRECTORY>
```

The URL can use `http`, `https`, or `file` protocols. Each prestate should be named as `<PRESTATE_HASH>.json` or `<PRESTATE_HASH>.bin.gz`.

### Building required prestates for chains not in the Superchain Registry

You'll need at least two prestates:

1.  The prestate currently used for permissioned games
2.  A new prestate matching the `faultGameAbsolutePrestate` configuration for permissionless games

<Callout type="info">
  The prestate used for permissioned games typically doesn't include the necessary chain configuration for permissionless fault proofs.
  When deploying a new chain, you must first deploy the contracts and then generate the correct chain configuration.
  As a result, the original permissioned prestate usually isn't suitable for permissionless operation.
  Therefore, it's common practice to generate and maintain two separate prestates.
  The challenger will need access to both in order to properly monitor existing permissioned games and newly activated permissionless games.
</Callout>

For chains not in the Superchain Registry, you need to build custom prestates with your chain's configuration:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism --recurse-submodules
cd optimism

# To build a specific prestate (e.g., for op-program/v1.5.0)
git checkout op-program/v1.5.0
make reproducible-prestate

# Generate the prestate with your chain's specific configuration
./op-program/bin/op-program \
  --l2.genesis /path/to/your/l2-genesis.json \
  --rollup.config /path/to/your/rollup-config.json \
  --network.l2chainid <YOUR_L2_CHAIN_ID> \
  --exec.prestate
```

The prestate will be generated at `op-program/bin/prestate.json` (or `prestate.bin.gz` for newer versions).

### Ensure sufficient funds for bonds

Unlike with permissioned games, the challenger will need to post bonds with each claim it makes.

As a general guideline:

*   Maintain a minimum balance of 50 ETH
*   Have access to a large pool of ETH for potential attack scenarios
*   Implement monitoring to ensure sufficient funds are always available

### Set up `op-dispute-mon`

Ensure `op-dispute-mon` is properly configured by following these [steps](/operators/chain-operators/tools/chain-monitoring#dispute-mon)

## 2. Deploy and configure smart contracts using OPCM

This section requires privileged actions by the `ProxyAdminOwner` and may involve the `Guardian` role depending on your security setup.

### Using OPCM for deployment

OPCM is the recommended tool for safely managing OP Stack upgrades:

```bash
# Install OPCM
git clone https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-chain-manager.git
cd op-chain-manager
npm install

# Configure OPCM with your chain's information
cp config.example.json config.json
# Edit config.json with your chain's specific addresses and parameters
```

### Set game implementations

Execute the following smart contract changes in a single bundled transaction:

1.  Call `setImplementation` on the `DisputeGameFactoryProxy` to:

    *   Set the implementation for the new permissionless `FaultDisputeGame` (game type `0`)
    *   Upgrade the permissioned game to the new `PermissionedDisputeGameAddress` (game type `1`) with the updated absolute prestate

    ```bash
    # Using OPCM to manage the upgrades <TODO>

    ```

2.  Upgrade the `AnchorStateRegistryProxy`:

    *   First upgrade to point to the `StorageSetter` contract and clear the initialized flag
    *   Then upgrade back to the `AnchorStateRegistry` implementation
    *   Call `initialize` with the anchor state for the new game type

    ```bash
    # First upgrade to the StorageSetter to clear initialization flag <TODO>
    
    ```

3.  Initialize bond amounts for each game type to exactly 0.08 ETH:
    ```bash
    # Set bond amounts for both game types <TODO>
    
    ```

The anchor state for permissionless games should match the current anchor state for permissioned games at the time of migration.

### Understanding ProxyAdmin Owner and Guardian roles

This migration requires actions by privileged roles in your system:

*   The **ProxyAdmin Owner** has the authority to upgrade proxy contracts.

*   The **Guardian** has emergency powers like pausing withdrawals but more limited capabilities than the ProxyAdmin Owner.

For detailed information about privileged roles and their security implications, refer to the [privileged roles documentation](/superchain/privileged-roles).

## 3. Testing off-chain agents

Before enabling permissionless proofs for withdrawals, thoroughly test your off-chain monitoring services.

### Test defending valid proposals

Create a valid proposal using the permissionless game type `0`:

1.  Ensure the proposal is from a block at or before the `safe` head:
    ```bash
    cast block --rpc-url <OP_GETH_ENDPOINT> safe
    ```

2.  Get a valid output root:
    ```bash
    cast rpc --rpc-url <OP_NODE_ENDPOINT> optimism_outputAtBlock \
      $(cast 2h <BLOCK_NUMBER>) | jq -r .outputRoot
    ```

3.  Create a test game:
    ```bash
    ./op-challenger/bin/op-challenger create-game \
      --l1-eth-rpc=<L1_RPC_ENDPOINT> \
      --game-factory-address <DISPUTE_GAME_FACTORY_ADDR> \
      --l2-block-num <BLOCK_NUMBER> \
      --output-root <OUTPUT_ROOT> \
      <SIGNER_OPTIONS>
    ```

4.  Verify:
    *   `op-challenger` logs a message showing the game is in progress
    *   `op-challenger` doesn't post a counter claim (as this is a valid proposal)
    *   `dispute-mon` includes the new game with `status="agree_defender_ahead"`

### Test countering invalid claims

Post an invalid counter claim to the valid proposal created above:

```bash
./op-challenger/bin/op-challenger move \
  --l1-eth-rpc <L1_RPC_ENDPOINT> \
  --game-address <GAME_ADDR> \
  --attack \
  --parent-index 0 \
  --claim 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 \
  <SIGNER_OPTIONS>
```

Verify that `op-challenger` posts a counter-claim to the invalid claim. You can view claims using:

```bash
./op-challenger/bin/op-challenger list-claims \
  --l1-eth-rpc <L1_RPC_ENDPOINT> \
  --game-address <GAME_ADDR>
```

There should be 3 claims in the game after this test.

## 4. Switch to permissionless proofs

After completing all previous steps and verifying their successful operation:

1.  Set the `respectedGameType` on the `OptimismPortal` to `CANNON` (game type `0`) using OPCM:
    ```bash
    npx opcm set-respected-game-type \
      --game-type 0
    ```

2.  Configure `op-proposer` to create proposals using the permissionless `cannon` game type:

    ```bash
    # Change from game-type 1 to 0
    --game-type 0
    ```

    Or via environment variable:

    ```
    OP_PROPOSER_GAME_TYPE=0
    ```

## Conclusion

Transitioning to permissionless proofs represents a significant security improvement for your OP Stack chain. This transition decentralizes the validation process, allowing any participant to challenge invalid withdrawal claims rather than relying on a limited set of trusted validators.

By following this guide, you'll be able to safely configure and test your system before making the switch to permissionless proofs. Remember to thoroughly test each service before proceeding to the next step, and ensure that your security monitoring is properly configured to track the health of the system after the transition.
