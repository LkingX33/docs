# Validating Your OP Stack Deployment

After deploying the L1 smart contracts for your OP Stack chain, it's crucial to verify that your deployment conforms to the standard configuration.
This guide walks you through using `op-validator` to validate your deployment against the Superchain standard.

## Why validate your deployment?

Validating your deployment ensures:

1.  **Standardization** - Your chain adheres to the Superchain standards
2.  **Interoperability** - Your chain will properly interact with other Superchain components
3.  **Security** - Your deployment follows best practices and security guidelines
4.  **Upgradeability** - Your chain can receive future protocol upgrades

## Prerequisites

*   Completed deployment of L1 smart contracts using [op-deployer](/operators/chain-operators/deploy/smart-contracts)
*   Generated genesis and rollup files
*   [op-validator](/operators/chain-operators/tools/op-validator) installed

## Validation process

<Steps>
  ### Install op-validator

  If you haven't already installed op-validator, follow the [installation instructions](/operators/chain-operators/tools/op-validator#installation).

  ### Prepare your configuration files

  Ensure you have the following files available:

  *   `genesis.json`: The L2 genesis file generated after contract deployment
  *   `rollup.json`: The rollup configuration file generated after contract deployment

  If you used op-deployer, these files can be obtained with:

  ```bash
  op-deployer inspect genesis --workdir .deployer <l2-chain-id> > .deployer/genesis.json
  op-deployer inspect rollup --workdir .deployer <l2-chain-id> > .deployer/rollup.json
  ```

  ### Validate against standard configuration

  Run the op-validator to check your deployment against the standard configuration:

  ```bash
  op-validator check-deployment \
    --l1-rpc <YOUR_L1_RPC_URL> \
    --rollup-config /path/to/rollup.json \
    --l2-genesis /path/to/genesis.json

  ```

  This command analyzes your deployment and checks for compliance with the standard configuration.

  ### Review the validation report

  The validation tool will output a report detailing:

  *   Conformity to standard contract deployment parameters
  *   Any deviations from the standard configuration
  *   Warnings about potential issues
  *   Recommendations for fixing non-standard configurations

  Example output:

  ```bash
  ✅ SystemConfig parameters are standard
  ✅ L1CrossDomainMessenger implementation is standard
  ✅ L1StandardBridge implementation is standard
  ⚠️ L2OutputOracle is using non-standard submission interval
  ✅ OptimismPortal implementation is standard
  ✅ Genesis L2 timestamp matches L1 block
  ```

  If the validator reports non-standard configurations, redeploy with corrected parameters, if you intend your chain to fully adhere to the Superchain standard.
</Steps>

## Next Steps

*   If you plan to join the Superchain, follow the [Standard Rollup Charter](/superchain/blockspace-charter).
*   Configure [monitoring and maintenance](/operators/chain-operators/tools/chain-monitoring)
