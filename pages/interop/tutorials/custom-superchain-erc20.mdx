# Custom SuperchainERC20 tokens

## Overview

This guide explains how to upgrade an ERC20 to a [`SuperchainERC20`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L2/SuperchainERC20.sol)  that can then teleport across the Superchain interop cluster quickly and safely using the [`SuperchainTokenBridge`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L2/SuperchainTokenBridge.sol) contract. For more information on how it works, [see the explainer](/interop/superchain-erc20).

To ensure fungibility across chains, `SuperchainERC20` assets must have the same contract address on all chains. This requirement abstracts away the complexity of cross-chain validation. Achieving this requires deterministic deployment methods. There are [many ways to do this](https://github.com/Arachnid/deterministic-deployment-proxy).
Here we will use the [SuperchainERC20 Starter Kit](/app-developers/starter-kit).

    <summary>About this tutorial</summary>

    **What you'll learn**

    *   How to deploy custom ERC20 tokens across multiple chains at the same address so that they can be bridged with the [`SuperchainTokenBridge`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L2/SuperchainTokenBridge.sol) contract.

    **Prerequisitve technical knowledge**

    *   Understanding of smart contract development
    *   Familiarity with blockchain concepts
    *   Familiarity with [standard SuperchainERC20 deployments](/interop/tutorials/deploy-superchain-erc20).

    **Development environment**

    *   Unix-like operating system (Linux, macOS, or WSL for Windows)
    *   Git for version control

</details>
### What you'll do

*   Use the [SuperchainERC20 Starter Kit](/app-developers/starter-kit) to deploy tokens with your custom code.

## Step by step

<Steps>
  ### Prepare for deployment

  1.  Follow the setup steps in the [SuperchainERC20 Starter Kit](/app-developers/starter-kit#setup).
      Don't start the development environment (step 5).

  2.  Follow [the deployment preparations steps](/interop/tutorials/deploy-superchain-erc20#prepare-for-deployment) in the issuing new assets page.
      Don't deploy the contracts yet.

      **Note:** Make sure to specify a previously unused value for the salt, for example your address and a timestamp.
      This is necessary because if the same constructor code is used with the same salt when using the deployment script, it gets the same address, which is a problem if you want a fresh deployment.

  ### Create the custom contract

  The easiest way to do this is to copy and modify the `L2NativeSuperchainERC20.sol` contract.
  Use this code, for example, as `packages/contracts/src/CustomSuperchainToken.sol`.

  ```solidity file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/CustomSuperchainToken.sol hash=4ad95b9203ce523351eba0501f8b972d 
  ```

  <details>
    <summary>Explanation</summary>

    ```solidity file=<rootDir>/public/tutorials/CustomSuperchainToken.sol#L36-L38 hash=4e402ea88c9cd796500425172a6de16d 
    ```

    This function lets users get tokens for themselves.
    This token is for testing purposes, so it is useful for users to get their own tokens to run tests.
  </details>

  ### Deploy the new token

  1.  Edit `packages/contracts/scripts/SuperchainERC20Deployer.s.sol`:

      *   Change line 6 to import the new token.

          ```solidity
          import {CustomSuperchainToken} from "../src/CustomSuperchainToken.sol";
          ```

      *   Update lines 52-54 to get the `CustomSuperchainToken` initialization code.

          ```solidity
          bytes memory initCode = abi.encodePacked(
                type(CustomSuperchainToken).creationCode, abi.encode(ownerAddr_, name, symbol, uint8(decimals))
          );
          ```

      *   Modify line 62 to deploy a `CustomSuperchainToken` contract.

          ```solidity
            addr_ = address(new CustomSuperchainToken{salt: _implSalt()}(ownerAddr_, name, symbol, uint8(decimals)));
          ```

  2.  Deploy the token contract.

  ```sh
  pnpm contracts:deploy:token
  ```

  <details>
    <summary>Sanity check</summary>

    1.  Set `TOKEN_ADDRESS` to the address where the token is deployed.
        You can also play with the token I created, which is at address [`0xF3Ce0794cB4Ef75A902e07e5D2b75E4D71495ee8`](https://sid.testnet.routescan.io/address/0xF3Ce0794cB4Ef75A902e07e5D2b75E4D71495ee8).

        ```sh
        TOKEN_ADDRESS=0xF3Ce0794cB4Ef75A902e07e5D2b75E4D71495ee8
        ```

    2.  Source the `.env` file to get the private key and the address to which it corresponds.

        ```sh
        . packages/contracts/.env
        MY_ADDRESS=`cast wallet address $DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY`
        ```

    3.  Set variables for the RPC URLs.

        ```sh
        RPC_DEV0=https://interop-alpha-0.optimism.io
        RPC_DEV1=https://interop-alpha-1.optimism.io
        ```

    4.  Get your current balance (it should be zero).

        ```sh
        cast call --rpc-url $RPC_DEV0 $TOKEN_ADDRESS "balanceOf(address)" $MY_ADDRESS | cast --from-wei
        ```

    5.  Call the faucet to get a token and check the balance again.

        ```sh
        cast send  --private-key $DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY --rpc-url $RPC_DEV0 $TOKEN_ADDRESS "faucet()"
        cast call --rpc-url $RPC_DEV0 $TOKEN_ADDRESS "balanceOf(address)" $MY_ADDRESS | cast --from-wei
        ```
  </details>
