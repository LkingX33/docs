# Estimating the cost of interop messages

There are several factors that determinate the cost of an [interop transaction](/interop/message-passing) (in addition to gas cost, etc. that apply to all transactions):

- How you pass the message.
  You can either use [`CrossL2Inbox`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L2/CrossL2Inbox.sol) directly, or use the cross domain messenger, [`L2ToL2CrossDomainMessenger`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L2/L2ToL2CrossDomainMessenger.sol), which uses `CrossL2Inbox` internally. 
- The transaction type.
  Every interop message has two transactions, an [initiating message](/interop/message-passing#initiating-message) in a transaction to the source chain, and an [executing message](/interop/message-passing#executing-message) in the destination chain.
- Whether autorelay is turned on.
  If it is turned on for a particular chain there is still an executing message, but the chain operator pays for it.

## CrossL2Inbox

This is the low level protocol.

### Initiating message

The initiating message here is just any log entry.
The cost of a log entry is [`375 + 375 per topic + 8 per byte of unstructured data`](https://www.evm.codes/?fork=cancun#a1).
A log entry emitted by Solidity always has at least one topic.

*   Build a [revolutionary app](/app-developers/get-started) that uses multiple blockchains within the Superchain
*   Deploy a [SuperchainERC20](/interop/tutorials/deploy-superchain-erc20) to the Superchain
*   Learn [how messages get from one chain to another chain](/interop/message-passing)
*   Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKc5RgjtGes), which gives an overview of Superchain interoperability.
