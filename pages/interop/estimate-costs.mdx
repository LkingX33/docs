# Estimating the cost of interop messages

<Callout type="info">
  At the time of writing (May 2025) the cost of a hundred interop messages is just a few cents.
  Unless the cost of OP Stack transactions rises significantly, the cost of interop is not an important consideration.

  To see the current cost of gas, go to a [block explorer](https://optimism.blockscout.com/) and look at a recent transaction.
</Callout>

There are several factors that determine the cost of an [interop transaction](/interop/message-passing):

*   How you pass the message.
    You can either use [`CrossL2Inbox`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L2/CrossL2Inbox.sol) directly, or use the cross domain messenger, [`L2ToL2CrossDomainMessenger`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L2/L2ToL2CrossDomainMessenger.sol), which uses `CrossL2Inbox` internally.
*   The transaction type.
    Every interop message has two transactions, an [initiating message](/interop/message-passing#initiating-message) in a transaction to the source chain, and an [executing message](/interop/message-passing#executing-message) in the destination chain.
*   Whether autorelay is turned on.
    If it is turned on for a particular chain, there is still an executing message when using `L2ToL2CrossDomainMessenger`, but the chain operator pays for it so you may not care.

## CrossL2Inbox

This is the low level protocol used by all interop protocols, including `L2ToL2CrossDomainMessenger`.

### Initiating message

The initiating message here is just any log entry.
A log entry emitted by Solidity code has 1–4 topics (t) and an unlimited number of unstructured data bytes (n).
The gas cost is  [*375(t+1)+8n*](https://www.evm.codes/?fork=cancun#a1).

### Executing message

The executing message cost has several components:

1.  The cost of posting the transaction.
2.  The cost of hashing the message.
3.  The cost of `CrossL2Inbox.validateMessage`.
4.  The cost of using the message.

The first and second components depend on the log entry.
`CrossL2Inbox.validateMessage` only requires a 32 byte hash of the log entry, but actually using it typically requires the information that has been hashed.

Additionally, you need to provide the `CrossL2Inbox` with how to find the log entry.
This is encoded in a [five member structure](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L2/CrossL2Inbox.sol#L7-L19), so *32×5=160* bytes.
And, of course, you need to call a function which requires a four byte selector.

So the number of bytes required is *164+32t+n*.

Every transaction posted costs at least *21,000* gas.
Compared with that, the hashing which costs approximately [*30+0.2×\<number of bytes>*](https://www.evm.codes/?fork=cancun#20), is negligible.
We can usually ignore the [memory expansion cost](https://www.evm.codes/about#memoryexpansion), unless the validating contract uses a really large amount of memory.

The cost of using the message is beyond the scope here, because it depends on your application.

So the main cost drivers are the 21,000 transaction gas cost has plus the cost of posting a *164+32t+n* byte transaction.

## Cross domain messenger

This higher level protocol adds some expenses, mostly because replay protection requires storage, and [writing to storage](https://www.evm.codes/?fork=cancun#55) is a relatively expensive operation.

### Initiating message

The initiating message is sent by [`L2ToL2CrossDomainMessenger.sendMessage`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L2/L2ToL2CrossDomainMessenger.sol#L128-L161). This function writes to storage twice.

It writes to [specify that the hash has a sent message](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L2/L2ToL2CrossDomainMessenger.sol#L157).
This would typically be written to previously empty storage, so the cost is *22,100* gas.

Then it [increments the nonce value](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L2/L2ToL2CrossDomainMessenger.sol#L158).
Overwriting previously used storage (which means storage where the present value is *not* zero) only costs *5,000* gas.

So, the initiating message costs a little over *27,100* gas, plus the negligible cost of emitting the log message, a few if statements, etc.
Of course, it is created as part of a transaction, so we might want to include the *21,000* transaction cost too.

### Executing message

If autorelay is turned on in a blockchain, then you don't care about the cost of the executing message.
The chain operator will bear the cost.

If autorelay is not turned on, the executing message is a call to [`L2ToL2CrossDomainMessenger.relayMessage`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L2/L2ToL2CrossDomainMessenger.sol#L197-L256).
The only storage operation here is [noting the hash has been used for a message already](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L2/L2ToL2CrossDomainMessenger.sol#L241).
This is previously unwritten storage, so we can expect to pay the tull *22,100* in gas.
Plus, of course, the *21,000* that any transaction costs.
All the other gas costs are negligible.

## Conclusion

Unless the message is *extremely* long, the cost of an interop message, taking both sides together, is unlikely to exceed *100,000* gas.
At the time of writing, each gas unit costs approximately `$3×10^-9`, so it would take about thirty messages to add up to a full cent.

## Next steps

*   Build a [revolutionary app](/app-developers/get-started) that uses multiple blockchains within the Superchain
*   Deploy a [SuperchainERC20](/interop/tutorials/deploy-superchain-erc20) to the Superchain
*   Learn [how messages get from one chain to another chain](/interop/message-passing)
*   Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKc5RgjtGes), which gives an overview of Superchain interoperability.
