# Pectra impact on user fees and chain profitability

The Ethereum L1 Pectra upgrade has introduced changes to calldata gas costs via EIP-7623 that will affect OP Stack chain profitability in specific configurations. This notice outlines the potential impact on your chain and recommends specific actions.

EIP-7623 increases the amount of gas payable for calldata transactions. These include such transactions as those used by OPStack chains _before the Ecotone upgrade_ when blob data availability (blob DA) was introduced.

Blob DA has now been the default and recommended option for the OPStack for some time, so almost all chains make use of it. Therefore the Optimism protocol's current fee pricing formula has remained unchanged.

Chains configured for blob data availability remain unaffected by the Pectra upgrade. However, chains configured for calldata (i.e. a legacy mode) may experience a reduction in profitability. It is even possible for such chains to be making a loss on data availabilty costs. Therefore all chains should check their config.

## Actions required

Since the Ecotone upgrade, the Optimism protocol prices L2 transactions using a function that incorporates L1 base fee, L1 blob base fee, and estimated data availability costs. "Ecotone scalars" in the SystemConfig contract determine this pricing.

Please review your [Ecotone scalar chain configuration](../operators/chain-operators/management/blobs.mdx) stored in the SystemConfig. If your chain uses a zero blob fee scalar, meaning it's configured to price for calldata only, you may need to update it. Otherwise, no action is necessary.

If your batcher is configured to submit using calldata _only_, then you should scale your blob base fee scalar by 16/10. This will ensure that, since you are paying exclusively for calldata DA, you are charging users appropriately such that your target profit margin is the same as it was before Pectra.

If your batcher is configured to submit using blob DA, or configured to automatically choose the cheaper of the two DA modes, then you should adjust your Ecotone scalars for blob DA pricing (meaning a nonzero blob base fee scalar). This will ensure that you are charging accurately for using blob DA. Without such a change it is likely that you are overcharging users.

As ever, you may continue to tweak the Ecotone scalars as desired in order to adjust the profitability of your chain.
