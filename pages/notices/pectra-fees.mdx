# Pectra impact on user fees and chain profitability

The Ethereum L1 Pectra upgrade has introduced changes to calldata gas costs via EIP-7623 that will affect OP Stack chain profitability in specific configurations. This notice outlines the potential impact on your chain and recommends specific actions.

EIP-7623 increases the amount of gas payable for calldata transactions. These include such transactions as those used by OPStack chains _before the Ecotone upgrade_ when blob data availability (blob DA) was introduced.

Blob DA has now been the default and recommended option for the OPStack for some time, so almost all chains make use of it. Therefore the Optimism protocol's current fee pricing formula has remained unchanged.

Chains configured for blob data availability remain unaffected by the Pectra upgrade. However, chains configured for calldata (i.e. a legacy mode) may experience a reduction in profitability. It is even possible for such chains to be making a loss on data availabilty costs. Therefore all chains should check their config.

## Actions required

Review your chain configuration if your chain uses a zero blob fee scalar (`sB=0`), meaning it's configured to price for calldata only, AND your chain uses calldata (not blobs) to post batches to L1.

No action is needed if your chain uses blob data availability (the default and recommended configuration) or your ecotone scalars already account for blob pricing.

## Technical background

Since the Ecotone upgrade, the Optimism protocol prices L2 transactions using a function that incorporates L1 base fee, L1 blob base fee, and estimated data availability costs. "Ecotone scalars" in the SystemConfig contract determine this pricing.

The current fee pricing formula is:

```
c = e(16sC·C + sB·B)·10^-6
```

Where:

*   e = estimated transaction size
*   C = L1 base fee
*   B = L1 blob base fee
*   sC = L1 base fee scalar
*   sB = L1 blob base fee scalar
*   16 = calldata cost per byte (pre-Pectra)

## Impact on chains

The Pectra upgrade through EIP-7623 increases calldata gas costs by a factor of 10/4 (from 16 to 40 gas per byte).

**No impact for chains that:**

*   Use blob data availability (most OP Stack chains)
*   Have ecotone scalars configured for a healthy profit margin (\~5%)

**Potential impact for chains that:**

*   Use calldata exclusively for batch posting
*   Have scalars configured only for calldata pricing (sB=0)

In extreme cases of unchecked negative profitability, a batcher might eventually exhaust its funds, resulting in a safe head stall.

### Detection

Chain operators should monitor their profitability by tracking the L1 Fee Vault balance and comparing this to the batcher balance.

### Mitigation

If adjustments are needed:

1.  **For chains using calldata by design:**  // What is the fix here??

2.  **For chains using or able to use blobs:** Ensure your blob fee scalar (sB) properly accounts for blob pricing, as the Pectra changes do not affect blob transactions.

Chain operators can update their ecotone scalars through the standard governance process for their deployment.
