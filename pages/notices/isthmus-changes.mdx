# Preparing for Isthmus breaking changes

This page outlines breaking changes related to the Isthmus network upgrade for chain operators and node operators.
If you experience difficulty at any stage of this process, please reach out to [developer support](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/developers/discussions).

<Callout type="info">
  The Isthmus upgrade for the Sepolia Superchain will be activated at **Tue Nov 26 at 15:00:00 UTC** (`1732633200`).
</Callout>

## What's included in Isthmus

Isthmus contains these main changes:

*   **Change 1**: Change description.
*   **Change 1**: Change description.

For more information on the Isthmus implementation details, please review [Isthmus specification](https://specs.optimism.io/protocol/isthmus/overview.html).

## For chain operators

Chain operators should upgrade their nodes ahead of the activation times to a release that contains the Isthmus changes and has the activation times for their chains baked in, or set the activation times manually via overrides.


### For fault proof enabled chains



## For node operators

Node operators will need to upgrade to the respective Isthmus releases before the activation dates.

These following steps are necessary for every node operator:

<Steps>
  ### Update to the latest release

  *   [`op-node` at `v1.10.2`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/releases/tag/op-node%2Fv1.10.2)
  *   [`op-geth` at `v1.101411.4`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/releases/tag/v1.101411.4)

  ### Configure the Isthmus activation date

  <Callout type="warning">
    If you are operating a node for an OP Chain that has opted into the [hardfork activation inheritance behavior](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/blob/main/docs/hardfork-activation-inheritance.md), the Isthmus activation date is part of the `op-node` and `op-geth` nodes. So, no action is needed for the sequencer after upgrading to the latest release. Please skip to [Step 3: Verify Your Configuration](#verify-your-configuration).

    For Sepolia that is: `OP Sepolia`, `Base Sepolia`, `Mode Sepolia`, `Zora Sepolia`, and `Metal Sepolia`.
  </Callout>

  For node operators of not included in the [hardfork activation inheritance behavior](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/blob/main/docs/hardfork-activation-inheritance.md), you will need to manually configure the activation. This can be done one of two ways:

  *   **Option 1:** Set the activation time in the `rollup.json` for `op-node`. You will still need to set the `override.isthmus` flag in `op-geth` if you use this option.
  *   **Option 2:** Set the activation time via overrides (CLI) in both `op-node` and `op-geth`. These will need to be set on `op-node` and `op-geth` for the sequencer and all other nodes.

  ### Verify Your Configuration

  Make the following checks to verify that your node is properly configured.

  *   `op-node` and `op-geth` will log their configurations at startup
  *   Check that the Isthmus time is set to `activation-timestamp` in the op-node startup logs
  *   Check that the Isthmus time is set to `activation-timestamp` in the op-geth startup logs
</Steps>
