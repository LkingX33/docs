# Upgrade 15: Isthumus Hard Fork

This page outlines breaking changes related to the Isthmus network upgrade for chain operators and node operators. The upgrade proposal is available [here](https://gov.optimism.io/t/upgrade-proposal-15-isthmus-hard-fork/9804) and the governance vote is available [here](https://gov.optimism.io/t/proposal-preview-implement-prague-features-on-the-op-stack/9703).

If you experience difficulty at any stage of this process, please reach out to developer support.

<Callout type="info">
  The Isthmus hard fork for the Sepolia Superchain will be activated at **Thu Apr 17 16:00:00 UTC 2025** (`1744905600`).
  This is for all chains who have opted into the [hard fork inheritance behavior](/superchain/superchain-registry#hard-fork-activation-inheritance-behavior). The activation for the Mainnet Superchain will be decided after Pectra activates on Ethereum. This time is still to be determined. The last tentative timeline from the Ethereum All Core Devs call is May 7th (from the call on Thursday, April 3rd).
</Callout>

## What's included in Isthmus

Isthmus contains these main changes:

*   **Implement Prague features on the OP Stack**: This includes the EIPs that are relevant to the L2 that are being added to Ethereum with its Pectra activation. Learn more about this [here](https://gov.optimism.io/t/proposal-preview-implement-prague-features-on-the-op-stack/9703).
*   **L2 Withdrawals Root in Block Header**: This lowers the lift for chain operators by allowing them to run a full node to operate `op-dispute-mon` making it easier to guarantee the security of the fault proofs for the chains in the Superchain as the number of chains scales. Learn more about this [here](https://gov.optimism.io/t/proposal-preview-l2-withdrawals-root-in-block-header/9730).
*   **Operator Fee**: A new component to the fee formula for the OP Stack which is a first step towards better resource pricing. This improves the OP Stack ability to support chains using Alt-DA or using ZK proving. Learn more about this [here](https://gov.optimism.io/t/proposal-preview-operator-fee/9715).

For more information on the Isthmus implementation details, please review [Isthmus specification](https://specs.optimism.io/protocol/isthmus/overview.html).

## For chain operators

Chain operators must upgrade their nodes ahead of the activation times to a release that contains the Isthmus changes and has the activation times for their chains baked in, or set the activation times manually via overrides. The details are outlined in the node operator section below. Additionally, chain operators must update `op-batcher` to [`v1.12.0`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/releases/tag/op-batcher%2Fv1.12.0) and should update `op-challenger` to [`v1.3.3`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/releases/tag/op-challenger%2Fv1.3.3). 

In addition to this, the L1 smart contract upgrades in [upgrade 14](/notices/upgrade-14) are required to utilize this new funcationality.

### For permissionless fault proof enabled chains

Chains running permissionless fault proofs will need to deploy new dispute game contracts with new absolute prestates. The new 64 bit version of cannon will be utilized moving forward. The Sepolia Superchain, will utilize [op-program/v1.6.0-rc.1](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/tree/op-program/v1.6.0-rc.1). The following permissionless fault proof Sepolia chains are: `Base Sepolia`, `Ink Sepolia`, and `OP Sepolia`.

<Steps>
  ### Verify the new absolute prestate

  The absolute prestate is generated with the [op-program/v1.6.0-rc.1](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/tree/op-program/v1.6.0-rc.1). You can use this new absolute prestate (`0x03394563dd4a36e95e6d51ce7267ecceeb05fad23e68d2f9eed1affa73e5641a`) for the following chains:

  *   Sepolia: Base, Creator Chain, OP, Metal, Mode, Zora, Ethernity, Unichain, Ink, and Minato (Soneium)

  You can verify this absolute prestate by running the following [command](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/5f003211aed7469eed7df666291a62c025d1c46c/Makefile#L129-L131) in the root of the monorepo on the `op-program/v1.6.0-rc.1` tag:

  ```shell
  make reproducible-prestate
  ```

  You should expect the following output at the end of the command:

  ```shell
  Cannon Absolute prestate hash:
  0x03526dfe02ab00a178e0ab77f7539561aaf5b5e3b46cd3be358f1e501b06d8a9
  Cannon64 Absolute prestate hash:
  0x03394563dd4a36e95e6d51ce7267ecceeb05fad23e68d2f9eed1affa73e5641a
  CannonInterop Absolute prestate hash:
  0x03ada038f8a81526c68596586dfc762eb5412d4d5bb7cb46110d8c47ee570d7e
  ```

  ### Upload your new preimage file

  During the previous step, you also generated the preimage of the absolute prestate, which is basically the op-program serialized into a binary file. You'll find that new file at `optimism/op-program/bin/prestate.bin.gz`. Rename that file to have the absolute prestate hash as the filename so it looks like `0x03394563dd4a36e95e6d51ce7267ecceeb05fad23e68d2f9eed1affa73e5641a.bin.gz`.

  Upload that file to where you're storing your other absolute preimage files. This should be the location where you're pointing your `--cannon-prestates-url` at. The `op-challenger` will grab this file and use it when it needs to challenge games.

  ### Deploy new dispute game contracts

  You will then take the absolute prestate and deploy new `FaultDisputeGame` and `PermissionedDisputeGame` contracts with that value. 

  ### Update the DisputeGameFactory

  You will then need to update the `DisputeGameFactory` to point to the new `FaultDisputeGame` and `PermissionedDisputeGame` contracts by calling `DisputeGameFactory.setImplementation`. 

  ### Execute the upgrade

  Once your `op-challenger` is ready with the new preimage, you can execute the "Set Dispute Game Implementation" transaction. Please simulate and validate that the expected output prior to executing the transaction.
</Steps>

The new op-program release that contains the Mainnet activation timestamps will be available soon.

## For node operators

Node operators will need to upgrade to the respective Isthmus releases before the activation dates.

These following steps are necessary for every node operator:

<Steps>
  ### Update to the latest release

  The releases are for the Isthmus Sepolia Superchain activation. Mainnet releases will be cut when the activation timestamp has been determined.

  *   [`op-node` at `v1.13.0`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/releases/tag/op-node%2Fv1.13.0)
  *   [`op-geth` at `v1.101503.2`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/releases/tag/v1.101503.2)

  ### Configure the Isthmus activation date

  <Callout type="warning">
    If you are operating a node for an OP Chain that has opted into the [hardfork activation inheritance behavior](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/blob/main/docs/hardfork-activation-inheritance.md) and are utilizing the network flags, the Isthmus activation date is part of the `op-node` and `op-geth` nodes. So, no action is needed for the sequencer after upgrading to the latest release. Please skip to [Step 3: Verify Your Configuration](#verify-your-configuration).

    The following chains are included but are subject to change: `Base Sepolia`, `Creator Chain Testnet`, `Ethernity Sepolia`, `Ink Sepolia`, `Lisk Sepolia`, `Metal Sepolia`, `Mode Sepolia`, `Minato (Soneium) Sepolia`, `OP Sepolia`, `Unichain Sepolia`, and `Zora Sepolia`.
  </Callout>

  For node operators of not using the [hardfork activation inheritance behavior](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/blob/main/docs/hardfork-activation-inheritance.md), you will need to manually configure the activation. This can be done one of two ways:

  <Callout type="info">
    The override flag for op-node was missed and will be added in the mainnet release. If you utilize the override flags, please just set the activation time in the rollup configuration file. 
  </Callout>

  *   **Option 1:** Set the activation time in the `rollup.json` for `op-node`. You will still need to set the `override.isthmus` flag in `op-geth` if you use this option. Please note that the chain configuration file is subject to a stricter format and needs to contain the `chain_op_config` outlined in the `op-node/v1.11.0` [release notes](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/releases/tag/op-node%2Fv1.11.0).
  *   **Option 2:** Set the activation time via overrides (CLI) in both `op-node` and `op-geth`. These will need to be set on `op-node` and `op-geth` for the sequencer and all other nodes.

  ### Verify Your Configuration

  Make the following checks to verify that your node is properly configured.

  *   `op-node` and `op-geth` will log their configurations at startup
  *   Check that the Isthmus time is set to `activation-timestamp` in the op-node startup logs
  *   Check that the Isthmus time is set to `activation-timestamp` in the op-geth startup logs
</Steps>
